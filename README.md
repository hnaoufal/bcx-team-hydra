# AI-powered Geopolitical Risk Assessment Tool

## Description
This project is an AI-powered tool designed to support supply chain risk managers in the identification, assessment, and mitigation of geopolitical risks that could impact supply chain operations.

## User Story
As a risk manager in charge of a global supply chain, I want to proactively identify geopolitical risks so that I can avoid or mitigate delays and bottlenecks affecting my delivery chain.

## Example Scenarios
- A risk manager identifies a rising tension in a region critical to their supply chain and uses the tool to evaluate the risk level and possible impacts.
- The tool alerts the user to a potential trade embargo that could affect their operations, allowing for preemptive adjustment of supply routes.
